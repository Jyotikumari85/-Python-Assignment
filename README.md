Question 1
The aim of this coding challenge is to create a program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not, irrespective of case. 
A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.
For example, "racecar" is a palindrome because it reads the same way forward and backward. 
## Solution.
The solution involves converting the given string to lowercase and then comparing it to its reverse. 
If both are the same, then the given string is a palindrome
